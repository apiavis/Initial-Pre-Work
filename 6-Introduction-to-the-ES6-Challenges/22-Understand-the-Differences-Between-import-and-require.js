  Title: Understand the Differences Between import and require
  Date: 4/14/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use an import statement to bring in just the desired
    function from a file, rather than all functions, which would occur when
    using a require statement.*/

"use strict";
import { capitalizeString } from "string_functions"
capitalizeString("hello!");
