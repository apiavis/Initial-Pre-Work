  Title: Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing
     string variable using the += operator.*/

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
