  Title: Escape Sequences in Strings
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use multpile escape characters within a single string
     to use characters that could not otherwise be typed out, and to change
     the spacing of a string when it is printed to the screen.*/

var myStr = '"FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"'; // Change this line
