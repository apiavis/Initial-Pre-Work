  Title: Iterate with JS While Loops
  Date: 4/14/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use a JS while loop to iterate through a section of
    code until a specific condition is no longer true.*/

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
