  Title: Create Decimal Numbers with JS
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to assign a decimal value to a variable. Decimals in
     computer science are commonly called floats. However, not all real numbers
     can be expressed as floats, because this can cause rounding errors.*/

var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = 5.7;
