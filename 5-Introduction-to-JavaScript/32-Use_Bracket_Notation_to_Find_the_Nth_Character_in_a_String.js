  Title: Use Bracket Notation to Find the nth Character in a String
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use bracket notation to find the nth character in
     a string. The nth character is determined by placing the desired index number
     inside the brackets (ex. firstName[n-1]).*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
