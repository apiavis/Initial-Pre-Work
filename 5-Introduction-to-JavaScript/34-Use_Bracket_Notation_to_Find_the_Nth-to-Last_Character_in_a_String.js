  Title: Use Bracket Notation to Find the nth-to-Last Character in a String
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use bracket notation to find the nth-to-last character
     in a string. The index of the nth-to-last character is determined by
     subtracting n from string.length).*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
