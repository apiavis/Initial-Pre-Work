  Title: Constructing Strings with Variables
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to insert variables into a string that is being built
     by using the + operator along with the name of the variable(s).*/

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Alicia Piavis";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
