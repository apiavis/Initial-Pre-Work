  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use bracket notation to find the last character in
     a string. The index of the last character is determined by subtracting
     1 from string.length).*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1];
