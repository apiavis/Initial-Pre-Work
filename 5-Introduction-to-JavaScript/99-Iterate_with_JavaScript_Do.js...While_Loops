  Title: Iterate with JS Do...While Loops
  Date: 4/14/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use a JS Do...While loop to ensure that code inside
    of a loop will execute at least once before the program exits the loop.*/

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.
do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
