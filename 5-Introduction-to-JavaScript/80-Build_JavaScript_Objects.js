  Title: Build JS Objects
  Date: 4/14/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to build an object in JS to store data in a structured
    way. The object I built is called myDog and has 4 properties.*/

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Astronaut",
  "legs":3,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Butch", "Princess", "Cheyenne"]
};
