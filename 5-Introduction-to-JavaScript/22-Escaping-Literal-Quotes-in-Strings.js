  Title: Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use quotation marks within a string without
     signifying the end of the string by using a backslash (\) before the
     quotation mark.*/

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
