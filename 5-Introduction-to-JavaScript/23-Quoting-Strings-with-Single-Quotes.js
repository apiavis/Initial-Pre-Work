  Title: Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use a combination of single and double quotes to
     use quotation marks or an apostrophe within a string, without having to use
     escape characters or ending the string early.*/

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
