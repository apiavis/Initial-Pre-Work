  Title: Appending Variables to Strings
  Date: 4/13/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to append a variable to a string using the +=
     operator.*/

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "fun";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
