  Title: Use Hex Code for Specific Colors
  Date: 4/9/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to use hex code to provide the value of a color.  Hex
    code uses six digits. For example, black in hex code is #000000.*/

<style>
  body {
    background-color: #000000;
  }
</style>
