  Title: Inherit Styles from the Body Element
  Date: 4/9/2019
  Project: Techtonic Pre-Work
  Summary: I learned how to apply styles to elements within the body by allowing
    the styles to be inherited from the body element's style rules.*/

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }

</style>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
